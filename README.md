### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Nolan Posey and I recently graduated from Eastern Washington University with my BS of Computer Science. I'm excited to finally get into the field and begin working on larger projects and showing the world what I'm made of!

## My preferred projects
My favorite type of projects would have to be web development/mobile app projects because there are many different aspects and technologies I get to explore while work on those projects. Out of the three parts these projects are composed of (Front-end, Back-end, and Server) I would have to say that working on the front-end is my favorite part of these projects. There are many design and style choices that can be made in developing these projects depending on the purpose of the project. I enjoy meticulously designing all the small components and watching them come together into the final product.
